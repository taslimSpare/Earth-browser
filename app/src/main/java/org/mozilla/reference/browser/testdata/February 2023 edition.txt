Access to clean water is a critical humanitarian concern. Many communities lack safe and reliable water sources, leading to health risks and waterborne diseases. Humanitarian efforts focus on providing clean water, improving sanitation, and promoting hygiene practices to ensure the well-being of vulnerable populations.

Education in emergencies is a key humanitarian issue. During crises, children often lose access to schooling, jeopardizing their future. Humanitarian organizations work to establish temporary learning spaces, provide educational materials, and train teachers to ensure continued education for affected children, promoting their resilience and long-term development.
